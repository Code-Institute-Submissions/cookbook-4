# Cookbook | Flask & PostgreSQL Data Centric Development Project

This is a web application which that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. It is a full stack web application (frontend and backend) that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database hosted in the cloud on Heroku platform as a service. Users can :
1.	View a list of recipes
2.	Add a new recipe and add ingredients and method to the recipe
3.	Manage static data like categories
4.	Edit and Delete any data
